UWorld::LineTraceSingleByObjectType()  : Enables raycasting

FCollisionObjectQueryParams(ECollisionChannel::ECC_PhysicsBody) : To check for physics enable actors

We need to add the physics handle component from the engine editor to our pawn

We assign physics handle in our cpp code by using FindComponentByClass<>()

Physicshandle is a pointer of UPhysicsHandleComponent

UInputComponent is used for custom input bindings
It is similar to UPhysicsHandle
After setting inputcomponent up bind the action to it
Input Event = IE_...
Key object for grabbing will be "this" since we need it to grab the object that is running the function.

UPrimitiveComponent is the component we need to grab or manipulate

FHitResult::GetComponent will return the component required

if the physicshandle has a grabbed component we have to update its location every tick so as to give the image that we are actually holding the object.

Base eye height is in the (self) area of the blueprint.

ATriggerVolume->GetOverlappingActos(AActor* Actor) to find what all actors are currently there in the trigger volume

AActor->FindComponentbyClass<UPrimitiveComponent>()->GetMass() to get the weight of the actor (Used in the trigger volume).
